# First Post

Over the years I've found myself writing. Opening the most convenient writing application on my machine, putting down some thoughts for half an hour and throwing the document into my cloud storage. To be re-read under no certain circumstances less a bout of nostalgia 5 years from now. I often look back fondly at these tidbits of writing, while not often written well, they certainly capture the thoughts at that period in time. 

That feeling of jotting down some ideas popped back up again recently as I read through some programmer reflections on their own blog, this lead me down a rabbit hole of 10+ years of their content and had me reflecting on my own cloud journals. 

So under no specific topics or deadlines, I'd like to view this as my cloud storage going forward. Probably not for every document, but I find the act of writing to be very reflecting.
